The repository consists of python implementation of the velocity gradient model enhanced physics informed deep learning.

The model is validated on simulated datasets exhibiting various traffic flow scenarios like the phantom traffic jams due to localised pertubation to an initially homogeneous traffic flow, shock waves and rarefaction waves
The NGSIM data used for real world validation of the model.
